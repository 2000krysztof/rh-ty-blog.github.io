On Monday morning I came in sort of worried as is was going to be a new environment with people I didn't know. I had been stressing all night beforehand but the first day didn't turn out too bad. When I first went in, I went to reception when I met someone who works here called Becky. She gave me a tag with my name on it that allowed me to open doors. Then another person called Jennifer came in who showed me and the rest of the students around the place. I recognised her from the emails. She gave us a tour of the building, along with another guys called Pat.

* We were brought into the offices where we were given our laptops.
* We were shown the canteen where we could have our food and drinks. There were also snacks supplied for us and the staff and we greatly enjoyed access to free food. There was also LEGO in the canteen that we were allowed to build on lunch. There was also a Nintendo Switch were we were allowed to play videogames such as Mario Kart
* We were then showed the Bolger Suite and introduced to James

James talked to us about some stuff in the Bolger Suite that I totally didn't forget about... We were also introduced to Dominic, who did this same programme in TY, then studied it in college and ended up working here. All of us 13 students were asked to share a fact about ourselves. I shared that I'm a drummer in a band, howver I noticed that I'm the only one who wasn't asked a followup question, but that's okay. Someone else called Riona mentionedshe's also in a band, howver she's the singer. A guy here called Cian also plays bass and someone else plays guitar. These 2 guys who I later found out are two twins in a triplet, Robert and Adam, talked about how they love racing karts. James leaned in at this point as he was greatly intrigued.

Next we did an icebreaker. Usually I don't like icebreakers but this one wasn't too bad. We were given the name of a celebrity or fictional character taped on our bacs and we had to ask yes or no questions to the other students. I was told mine was a female solo musician, and I finally guessed Lady Gaga after I find out my person was also an actor. Someone called Keelan had Luke Skywalker from Star Wars on his back and it took him about 20 minutes to guess it. I found that very funny. The hints were so obvious, even after learning he hasn't seen Star Wars I don't know how he didn't get it.

For the next hour or so, Jennifer, Jen for short, suggested that we play on the Nintendo Switch. We all took our turns at playing Mario Kart, unfortunately I didn't win any races but on my first race I came second. At this point I was becoming frienly with Robert. He seems funny so that made me happy. Towards the end of playing Mario Kart, Dominic and Viktor joined in and they talked about school in Mount Sion. Viktor knew some people I know in Mount Sion like my friends Quinn and Philip. After Mario Kart, two girls called Kayla and Katelyn talked to me for a bit but I found it awkward. Then Robert came over and start talking so that saved me a bit. We started talking about my band.

Next we had our proper lunch break for an hour from 1pm to 2pm. I got some snacks from the canteen and sat down with Robert for most of my lunch. Towards the end of it, me, Robert, Oisin, Adam, Cian and Jack went into the pool room and Robert and Oisin played pool. Robert also followed me on Instagram and TikTok. Then we went back to the Bolger Suite once lunch was over.

Next we were taught about a process called Agile, which the engineers use to work on projects requested by customers. They let us demonstrate our own attempts at using it by customising figures of MR Potato Head from Toy Story. One of the workers pretended to be a customer and gave us a request to customise it. Me, Jack and Kayla had to make a hero themed Potato Head. We had to put sticky notes under the categories of "To do", "Do" and "Doing" as we acquired the requested pieces. We could find many hero parts so we went for more of an anti-hero theme after I found arms belonging to Darth Vader even though the figure was wearing an Iron Man mask. Our customer had one reqest to change it, and it was to change the eyes. They now had blue eyelashes and stuck out more. We soon had to go up and present our project. It was quite interesting because beforehad, I got distracted and moved the arms on top of the head and on the back. When we went up i played off the arn on the back as a built-in back scratcher for Mr Potato Head, and everyone found that funny. Jack commented on how we managed to "Keep it PG". Afterwards we had to write sticky notes about things that went well, things we could improve, etc. I didn't know what to write so I just drew a Stormstrooper and i found it funny when the guy reading them read out the last sticky note as "Stormtrooper with a gun". We then got a short break for around 10 minutes.

Last thing in he day, we had a talk about something but somehow I've completely blanked on what it was about... Oops. Well, at least we got to finish earky at 4, rather than the usual finish time at 5. I waited around for a bit and got a hot chocolate in the canteen because my mom waan't finished work until half 4. Luckily she works nearby so i walked there and went home.
