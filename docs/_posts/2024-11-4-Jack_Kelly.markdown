## Monday
On Monday morning, I came in the doors and we gathered in the reception. We were then shown to our desks and had to sign into our laptops. After a while of it not working, we were brought into the bolger room and were giving an introduction on the office space and what we would be working on. Then we were giving a tour on the office space and were shown the rooms we could go to, the kitchen and the games area and pool room. We were told we can eat the free snacks that are there and that is what we are gonna do. We played a game of icereakers where there was a celebrity stuck to ourback and had to ask people questions to find out who we were.    
      After all that, we had a three hour break where we played pool and had a mario cart tournament. I rather pool. We then went back to the bolger room and learned about agile. the way they showed us was by giving us mr potato heads and giving us a theme to design the heads. My groups theme was an adventurer and it was looking pretty good. After two more short breaks, we were brought into the room where we signed up for a github account and got started with how to edit our blogs for the week. this took about 30 mins and soon we were finishing up early.   
         The first day was fun and gamesand tomorrow we will be starting our blogs and learning about fedora.

 ## Tuesday

Today was more of a laptop and coding day than the fun day we had yesterday. We started off the day with a standup where we each have to say what we did yesterday and what we are going to do today. The standup is at half 9 and thn we were straight into coding at 10. We started off with the fedora terminal which was confusing at the start but then we got the hang of it.              At 11 we started working on the first day of the blog and Pat tawt us how to work GitHub and how to edit our blogs. At 1 we went for our lunch and me and the lads went up tot the shop for a bit of grub. After Lunch we had a talk about college life and how Jen, evan and sean got on in there time of college. We took a 10 minute break where we continued the pool tournament that e started at the previous lunch and then we were back in the bolger for te talk about women in coding. The talk didnt last very long as there was no questions and now it is half 3 and im working on the Tuesday section of the blog. I have no clue what we are doing tomorrow so im just gonna have to find out on the whiteboard table tomorrow. I drank too much orange drink today.
